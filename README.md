 🦠 COVID-19 Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project presents a domain-specific sentiment analysis approach to understand global public opinion on the COVID-19 pandemic using tweets. The dataset used is sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/), consisting of COVID-related tweets labeled with sentiments.

## 🧠 Objective

To analyze and classify sentiments (positive, neutral, negative) expressed in COVID-19 tweets using both machine learning and deep learning techniques. The insights aim to help understand public reaction and trends during the pandemic.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, NLTK, TensorFlow/Keras  
- **Models Used:**
  - Machine Learning: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Multinomial Naïve Bayes  
  - Deep Learning: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

## 📊 Features

- Data cleaning & preprocessing of tweets (tokenization, stemming, stopword removal)
- Sentiment labeling into positive, neutral, or negative
- Training multiple models (ML & DL)
- Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
- Visualization of sentiment distribution and model performance

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/covid-twitter-sentiment.git
cd covid-twitter-sentiment
````

2. Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the main notebook or Python script:

```bash
python main.py
```

> Ensure the dataset from the UCI repository is placed inside the `data/` folder.

## 📈 Results

The best-performing model was the **LSTM**, which achieved high F1-score and captured the sequential nature of text better than traditional ML models.
